### Project objective
Have a discord bot able to:
- Save user ratings
- Display ratings
- Change/remove ratings
- Show top rated movies from the server
- Show lesser rated movies from the server
- Show top rated movies per category

*Maybe we'll have a website that will be able to show all the informations as well as through bot commands.*

### ðŸš§ Future functionalities & bug fixes ðŸš§
- Make command take IMDB link as a parameter
- Make command print user ID instead of username
- Use local database to save data
- Display rating from a user for a specific movie
- Change rating for a specific movie
- Remove rating for a specific movie
- Change command to a webhook with reactions for ratings instead of command options
